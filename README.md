This app calculates the distance between two airports in the United States in nautical miles. Utilizing the Air-Port-Coes API and autocomplete function, the program gets the latitude and longitude of the selected airports, outputs the distance, and plots markers on a Google Map along with a line connecting the two points.

## Installation/Usage
Go to your terminal and enter the following commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the program will run on `localhost:3000`
